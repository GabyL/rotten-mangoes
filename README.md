A parody of RottenTomatoes with films that may or may not exist! 

* My first Ruby on Rails application.
* Users can add movies and review them. They are also able to search for movies by duration, movie name or director!
* Images are uploaded using the CarrierWave gem.
* Admins can manage users. Users are sorted into tables and paginated with the Kaminari gem.
